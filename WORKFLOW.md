# Snow Globe Lab blocked authorized model preflight handoff

## Outcome and scope

- The user authorized the exact Ollama `qwen3.5:4b` pull and frozen local-only benchmark. Preflight remains blocked: the current reviewed C: snapshot has 4,571,758,592 bytes free, which is 1,870,692,352 bytes below the conservative `>= 6,442,450,944` bytes (6 GiB) gate. Values fluctuate and must be remeasured before any repair execution. A dedicated empty `E:\AIModels\Ollama` store remains available; it contains 0 model bytes.
- Controlled Ollama 0.18.2 on isolated `127.0.0.1:11435`, cloud-off, one-parallel reported GPU bootstrap `initial_count=0` and `total_vram=0`, including forced `cuda_v13` and the exact GPU UUID. `nvidia-smi` confirms RTX 2070 SUPER CC 7.5, driver 581.42, CUDA 13.0, and 8192 MiB. The installed Ollama directory has 7 files/69,826,339 bytes and no GPU libraries. Controlled PIDs were stopped and 11435 is closed.
- The official v0.32.14 updater was relocated to `E:\AIModels\OllamaRuntimeRepair\updater\OllamaSetup-v0.32.14.exe` (1,564,916,544 bytes; SHA-256 `63061ab02eab0644ec8db56807d8f3e79be19ade9e7c5839014bfc01fd6f1a01`; same valid Ollama Inc. signature/version). Six attributable temporary artifacts totaling 247,012 bytes were moved under the repair tree; no unrelated data was moved. Deep review corrected unsafe inherited/explicit ACLs: the final tree has 3 directories, 7 files, no reparse points, owner/group `hunte`, protected directories, and files inheriting exactly FullControl for `hunte`, `SYSTEM`, and `Administrators` only. The source updater is absent. Final relocation-containment review is GO with no P0-P2 findings. Global issue `WI-GLOBAL-2026-117` remains Open T1 because runtime repair is blocked.

## Validation and review

- No model pull, model/provider inference, credentials, simulation changes, code edits, tests, or `src/societies/` changes occurred. Earlier lab evidence remains 296/296 Release tests, a 0-warning/0-error Release build, and deep-review CODE GO with no P0-P2 findings.

## Repository and delivery state

- This is a local documentation handoff only; no push or PR occurred. No installer execution, Ollama server, model pull, inference, or benchmark occurred. Final state has no Ollama processes/listeners, both model stores are empty, and Git/src are untouched. The exact model authorization remains paused; after runtime repair, a fresh runtime-bound single-use capability is required. The exploratory two-tier paid architecture discussion is not durably recorded here and remains pending user direction.

## Risks and exactly one next action

- The runtime cannot currently prove CUDA/GPU discovery despite independently verified hardware. The contained signed updater tree is ready but unexecuted; no model quality, latency, VRAM-fit, or Societies behavior evidence exists yet.
- Next action: decide whether to free or authorize the exact additional C: cleanup needed to reach `>= 6,442,450,944` bytes free, or keep the local lane paused.

# Snow Globe Lab authorized local-model boundary and research handoff

## Outcome and scope

- Added the isolated production-capable Ollama benchmark boundary and current model research. The runner requires an explicit immutable single-use authorization bound to the exact plan, canonical loopback endpoint, installed artifact identity/digest/quantization, and runtime process identity.
- The boundary strictly validates `/api/tags` and `/api/generate`, bounds FIFO queueing, response parsing, and VRAM sampling, poisons an endpoint after cancellation-ignoring transport, validates proposals only in a disposable scratch world, and records metrics-only evidence. The deterministic simulation and event ledger remain the only state-change authority.
- Official Qwen3.8 is documented as a frontier/background option (27B dense and 2.4T-A95B collection), not a practical 8 GB local tactical model. The recommended first separately approved local candidate is Ollama `qwen3.5:4b` at approximately 3.4 GB Q4_K_M, using the frozen 4K-context/96-output benchmark cell. See [LOCAL_MODEL_RESEARCH_2026-08-16.md](labs/Societies.SnowGlobe/LOCAL_MODEL_RESEARCH_2026-08-16.md).

## Validation and review

- `dotnet test tests/Societies.SnowGlobe.Tests/Societies.SnowGlobe.Tests.csproj --configuration Release --no-restore` — 296/296 passed.
- `dotnet build labs/Societies.SnowGlobe/Societies.SnowGlobe.csproj --configuration Release --no-restore` — 0 warnings, 0 errors.
- `git diff --check` — passed. Independent final deep review returned CODE GO with no P0-P2 findings.

## Repository and delivery state

- Focused local commits are `98231bf` (authorized Ollama benchmark boundary) and `26c1d65` (current local model research strategy), with this documentation reconciliation remaining local. No push or PR occurred.
- No model weights were downloaded, no Ollama server was started, and no live model/provider/network inference occurred. No credentials, Godot/src gameplay, or authoritative runtime change occurred. Live quality remains unmeasured.

## Risks and exactly one next action

- Qwen3.8 does not fit the 8 GB local tactical envelope; any background or remote evaluation requires a separate hardware/network/credential decision. The exact local artifact digest, runtime behavior, latency, VRAM fit, and Societies quality remain unmeasured until a real run.
- Next action: decide whether to authorize downloading the exact Ollama `qwen3.5:4b` artifact for one local-only benchmark under the frozen contract, or keep the lab offline.

# Snow Globe Lab durable participant-session handoff

## Outcome and scope

- Added paused, bounded structured participant commands through the same atomic expected-identity world validator. Durable accepted/stale/domain-rejected receipts are idempotent; transient admission failures do not consume keys. No free-form participant text, authentication, provider, network, Godot, or gameplay permission system was added.
- Advanced create-new persistence to `snow_globe_run_store/v3` with one compound participant-evaluation record, tick-boundary grammar, contiguous participant/scheduled events, bounded receipt reconstruction, framed scheduled ticks, strict record shapes, and writer poison semantics. V2 remains strict read-only compatibility and is never upgraded in place.
- Added `SnowGlobePersistedSession` as the single owner of v3 world/store/identified-adapter/pause/operation state. It restores durable state after managed failures, binds adapter provenance before artifacts, rejects mutable v2 sessions, fail-closes on poison or reconstruction mismatch, and supports bounded snapshots plus safe reentrant/concurrent disposal.

## Validation and review

- `dotnet test tests/Societies.SnowGlobe.Tests/Societies.SnowGlobe.Tests.csproj --configuration Release --no-restore` — 239/239 passed.
- `dotnet build labs/Societies.SnowGlobe/Societies.SnowGlobe.csproj --configuration Release --no-restore` — 0 warnings, 0 errors.
- `git diff --check` — passed. Independent architecture, migration, integration, and adversarial deep-review cycles concluded FINAL CODE GO with no P0-P3 findings.

## Repository and delivery state

- Focused local commits on `feature/snowglobe-agent-lab-owner-v1`: `67fa265` participant/world authority, `52bafb2` v3 persistence, and `03602af` persisted session. This documentation update is the remaining local commit. No push, PR, merge, provider/model call, download, network listener, GPU probe, Godot integration, or `src/societies/` change occurred.
- The deterministic world validator and canonical event ledger remain the only state-change authority. Participant identity is an opaque lab token, not real authentication or authorization.

## Risks and exactly one next action

- V3 has no v2 migration; old v2 artifacts remain historical/read-only. Observed low-level I/O poisons the live writer, and process-crash atomicity is not claimed. The 8 GB local-model budgets remain an unmeasured contract.
- Next action: decide whether to authorize one bounded live loopback benchmark under the frozen preflight contract; otherwise keep the lab offline.

# Snow Globe Lab persistence, preflight, and observer handoff

## Outcome and scope

- Hardened the isolated lab's persistence and resilience evidence without changing `src/societies/` or the authoritative Godot runtime. `snow_globe_run_store/v2` is intentionally breaking and rejects v1; exact identity, full-tick schedule, world/checkpoint continuity, strict bounded artifacts, whole-operation locking, corruption rejection, deterministic replay, and non-rewrite behavior are covered.
- Added a pure offline loopback preflight for one future shared local model server and an 8 GB benchmark contract that derives bounded metrics-only evidence. It opens no socket and performs no download, model call, GPU probe, credential, redirect, retry, or provider action.
- Added headless pause/resume/bounded-step/inspect controls. Candidate execution and live validator replay are transactional for adapter failures; exclusive world ownership and exact post-commit identity fail closed on external mutation; event inspection is paged and keeps a cached full digest.

## Validation and review

- `dotnet test tests/Societies.SnowGlobe.Tests/Societies.SnowGlobe.Tests.csproj --configuration Release --no-restore` — 141/141 passed.
- `dotnet build labs/Societies.SnowGlobe/Societies.SnowGlobe.csproj --configuration Release --no-restore` — passed with 0 warnings and 0 errors.
- `git diff --check` — passed; independent deep review returned CODE GO with no findings after adversarial corruption, identity, concurrency, evidence, and observer-ownership corrections.

## Repository and delivery state

- Code is split into focused local commits on `feature/snowglobe-agent-lab-owner-v1`; this handoff documentation is the remaining local commit. No push, PR, merge, live provider/model, download, network listener, Godot integration, participant command, or full-gameplay change was authorized or performed.
- The deterministic world and validator remain the only state-change authority. Loopback benchmark evidence and live-model quality remain unverified because no model was invoked.

## Risks and exactly one next action

- V2 has no v1 migration by design; old lab artifacts must remain historical rather than being opened as v2. The observer requires exclusive mutation ownership. The 8 GB budgets are a contract, not measured hardware evidence.
- Next action: decide whether to authorize one bounded live loopback benchmark against the frozen preflight contract; without that decision, keep the lab offline.

# W3-03 milestone handoff

# Snow Globe Lab first vertical slice handoff

# Snow Globe Lab scheduling comparison handoff

## Outcome

- Added the separate first scheduling experiment under `labs/Societies.SnowGlobe/` with focused tests under `tests/Societies.SnowGlobe.Tests/`; `src/societies/` remains unchanged.
- Both modes use the same recorded scripted responses and frozen shared per-tick observations. Sequential deliberation awaits them in stable order; controlled parallel deliberation collects them concurrently, then both enter the same ordinal validation/commit path.
- Canonical state/event replay matches for both modes. A deterministic gate fixture proves eight concurrent in-flight requests and reverse-order completion for controlled parallel versus one request in flight for sequential. Metrics are logical recorded latency units, critical-path latency, throughput, and equal dispatch coverage (not a broader fairness claim); malformed/failing responses are rejected without an action commit, and invalid latency contributes zero units.

## Evidence

- `dotnet build labs/Societies.SnowGlobe/Societies.SnowGlobe.csproj --configuration Release --no-restore` — passed, 0 warnings / 0 errors.
- `dotnet test tests/Societies.SnowGlobe.Tests/Societies.SnowGlobe.Tests.csproj --configuration Release --no-restore` — passed, 14/14, including deterministic out-of-order completion and missing/mismatch/null/nonpositive-latency/wrong-agent/explicit-failure/generic-exception fail-closed fixtures.
- `git diff --check` — passed.

## Canonical evaluation report outcome

- Added `snow_globe_scheduling_evaluation/v1`, a provider-neutral, file-I/O-free builder of stable UTF-8 JSON for the completed fixed comparison. Its ordered schema contains scenario identity, both mode digests and metrics, state/event/replay verdicts, and `logical_not_wall_clock` timing semantics only.
- Repeated experiment runs produce byte-identical reports; required fields/order and exact metrics/digests are tested. Before allocation, each world/run must match the fixed tick, digests, mode counters, round shape, and dispatch coverage; advanced worlds, swapped modes, incoherent digests, and coherent non-equivalent results are rejected. The independently frozen v1 golden JSON SHA-256 is `20bde9bd80da960f27ebb892576924a604128d01f2659bbb50cfded53a64103c`, BOM-free and without a trailing newline.
- Focused Release build remains 0 warnings / 0 errors; current focused lab tests pass 32/32.

## Parameter experiment outcome

- Added a separate mock-only exact ordered 4/8/16 × every-tick/every-other-tick matrix. It reuses the existing frozen shared-snapshot scheduler for four planning rounds per cell and advances deterministic idle ticks for the slower cadence.
- A deterministic mock gate measures peak in-flight work per cell: sequential is 1 and controlled parallel is exactly the 4/8/16 cohort, capped at 16. Canonical report input rejects missing, duplicate, and reordered cells; it derives positive matched total logical latency from the immutable fixture, requires sequential critical path to equal it and parallel critical path to equal recorded per-round maxima, and validates recomputed throughput, dispatch coverage/turns, round shape, and related counters before serialization.
- `snow_globe_parameter_experiment/v1` is file-I/O-free, provider-neutral, and uses `logical_not_wall_clock` semantics; the fixed scheduling v1 contract is unchanged. Focused Release build remains 0 warnings / 0 errors; focused lab tests pass 32/32.

## Boundary and next action

- Research-only and offline: no provider/model/network/credential use, Godot integration, runtime change, merge, push, or promotion.
- A later experiment may vary bounded cohort size or fixture latency while retaining the frozen-snapshot and ordered-commit contract.

## Outcome

- Added the separate local-only headless lab at labs/Societies.SnowGlobe/ with tests at tests/Societies.SnowGlobe.Tests/; src/societies/ is unchanged.
- Persistent agent records and deterministic world state are separate from the value-only, provider-neutral inference interface. The initial scripted adapter is offline only.
- Eight fixed-seed agents run sequential observe -> deliberate -> validate -> commit turns, gather shared resources, construct one shelter and one storage asset, then maintain the shelter. Committed actions are replayable through canonical event/state digests.

## Evidence

- dotnet build labs/Societies.SnowGlobe/Societies.SnowGlobe.csproj --configuration Release --no-restore - passed, 0 warnings / 0 errors.
- dotnet test tests/Societies.SnowGlobe.Tests/Societies.SnowGlobe.Tests.csproj --configuration Release --no-restore - passed, 4/4.
- git diff --check - passed.

## Risks and next action

- This is research infrastructure only: no real model/provider, credential, network, Godot observer shell, or production-runtime integration was added.
- Next bounded decision: compare a bounded batched-planning scheduler against the sequential baseline without relaxing deterministic validation and commit order.

## Outcome

- W3-02 merged through PR #123 at origin/master `d9e297f`. W3-03 implementation is committed locally at `a513636` on `feature/v3-w3-03-wetland-consequences`; docs/evidence publication is pending and GitHub delivery remains pending.
- The bounded slice adds session-owned deterministic wetland consequences, exact Protect/DrawDown per-unit quota and health rules, player+AI pre-ledger enforcement, canonical events, cached exhausted planning projection, strict schema-v9 persistence with v5-v8 migration/legacy continuation, and a minimal policy/health/quota/consequence HUD.
- W3-04+ remain inactive; another explicit **Continue V3** decision is required before activation. No LLM/fallback, restoration jobs, general law system, market, or broad UI was added.

## Validation and evidence

- Validation: focused wetland+artifact 37/37, core 129/129, UI 13/13; authoritative wrapper exit 0 in 416.9 s; Debug 0; full Release 442/442 with 0 failed/skipped; Godot 23/23; Release/ExportRelease 0 warnings/errors; deep review GO with no P0-P3 findings across 23 files (1,809/86).
- Performance: clean 14/14 pairs and 354/354 hashes; raw matrix `target_missed` (not safety failure), while established milestone gate is green at reference median p95/max `43.1679/213.4861 ms`, both soaks and forced invalidation green/deterministic, and c24 non-gating. No same-session A/B was run, so W3-02 comparison is non-causal.
- [Validation evidence](planning/active/evidence/v3-w3-03-validation.json) and [performance evidence](planning/active/evidence/v3-w3-03-performance-validation.json).

## Preserved context and risks

W2-VIS timing/visual-readback waivers, W2-06 history, Demo 1 concept classification, and historical schema/timing facts remain unchanged. Author/external clarity smoke and browser/device certification were not performed. Raw `target_missed`, no A/B causality, and recovered performance-worker workspace replacement are residual risks; issue records are WI-SOCIETIES-2026-009 and WI-GLOBAL-2026-078.
